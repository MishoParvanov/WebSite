        league titles and Juventus (36 league titles). They have also won the Coppa Italia five times,
        and the Supercoppa Italiana seven. Milan's home games are played at San Siro, also known as the
        Stadio Giuseppe Meazza. The stadium, which is shared with city rivals Internazionale, is the
        largest in Italian football, with a total capacity of 75,923. They have a long-standing rivalry
        with Inter, with whom they contest the Derby della Madonnina; it is one of the most followed
